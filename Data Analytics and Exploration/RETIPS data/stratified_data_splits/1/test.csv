Describe in detail your example of an 'adjustment' or coping strategy or preventive practice.

From the first days in March when technologist in the Ultrasound Department were informed by leaders within the Department of Radiology  that they did not need nor would be supplied eye protection along with the ever changing PPE updates and policies on which essential workers should use certain protection from the Enterprise  I knew where to find and shared the correct  updated and appropriate information from the State and Federal government to my co-workers in order to  protect ourselves and  our families from possibly catching the virus and spreading it to the many patients we care for daily while within 1-6 feet directly caring for them for over 30 minutes. Knowing where to find the correct source of information outside of the leadership & enterprise enabled me to know how to protect myself and co-work and allowed me to communicate safety with them. I purchased back in March safety goggles using my own money for all of the technologists employed within the ultrasound department which we have universally worn with our masks since March and still do today even though  eye protection has only become universal enterprise wide since the end of July. A few of us received Coronovirus mandatories from Administration containing all of the policies and play book rules from the enterprise for employees and leaders and to date implement them even when the Department as a whole does not.  Each of my co-workers along with myself have went above and beyond throughout this pandemic by stepping us a leaders in various situations of differing roles and communicated with each other the proper policies  procedures and information in order to prevent infection and in order to control safety amongst the technologist and patients. To date  many of us are still applying these methods and using the information from the State and Federal government along with the updated policies and protocols which legally must be followed and listed within the policy playbook so that we can maintain following the appropriate guidelines and direction outlined by the Enterprise itself without any direction or lead from the Department or its leaders.,1

In addition we had to develop a way to identify PUI and triage these patients appropriately.  Nursing developed a routine for patient arrival and waiting. We identified a suitable room for intubation and a work flow to keep staff and patient as safe as possible during an MRI with GA for PUI.  This still takes significant resources (time  staff  PPE  filters for anesthesia machines  use of an MRI tech for PPE monitor  extra anesthesia tech  closure of MRI scanner for 1 hour  No use of IR 4/Fluoro room for entire procedure (3 hours). This required considerable cooperation between multiple departments as well as IPC guidance in this unique environment.,1

Could you describe any opportunities to improvise  that you discovered and leveraged to make the process safer?,For the Department of Radiology and its highest leaders to ensure the policies of the Coronavirus Play book mandated by the enterprise are being followed. There is still opportunity for the Department heads and leaders to improvise currently in order to prevent the spread of the virus and protect the safety of its workers and the patients they care for. To date  certain policies such as ensuring a patient who has a trach or is vented when visiting any modality within radiology  is treated and handled using proper precaution of preventing the spread of the virus by ensuring that when visiting the department in the hospital they are cared for as a positive coronavirus patient would be with staff wearing all precaution they would as someone airborne and positive for COVID 19 and brought up to the department and room their study will be performed in by the technologist and not left in the waiting room per the Coronavirus policy playbook which requires handling any patient with a vent or trach to be handled this way when entering the hospital in order to take the proper precaution in the event the patient is asymptomatic or an unknown positive so that the virus may remain contained and the threat of spreading is not existent. Although this policy should be followed hospital wide it is not being following in the majority of all modalities within radiology and these policies should be implemented and communicated to all modalities and the enforcement of mandating the implementation of these policies should exist by the leaders and heads of the department along with the other rules and polices regarding Coronavirus from the enterprise just as the Department implements  mandates and ensures the policy of HR pre-pandemic.,0
