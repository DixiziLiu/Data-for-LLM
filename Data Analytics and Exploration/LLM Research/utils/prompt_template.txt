### Instruction:
Here are two lists of short text documents, \
'Resource-related' and 'Non-resource-related'. \
They are survey responses by hospital staff at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).
'Resource-related' is responses on the topic \
"Availability of resources OR Knowing where to find resources". 
'Non-resource-related' is responses that do not have to do with that topic.
Please give me a new example of a short text document that would belong \
in the '{category}' category. 
Please don't copy or paraphrase the text documents in the \
input lists I give you; instead, come up with your own new 20 to 25 examples \
that would belong in the '{category}' list.
